Modifications made to gutenberg html files
==========================================
1)I removed all the intro text divs from every document which outlines details of the ebook and copyright details

2)I added a few hr tags for changes the theme

3)I added the html tags for my custom fonts in the head tag

4)I changed the cover image urls to cover1,cover2 respectively so that they all are in a single directory

5)And of course, moved all the CSS to a separate file to standardize one CSS for 3 documents
